<div><h2> why visit nizwa?</h2></div><br>
<p> On a plain surrounded by a dense oasis of palm trees and some of the tallest mountains in Oman, the ancient town of Nizwa with its massive fort and high-walled souq is located.
 Nizwa was formerly avoided by British explorer Wilfred Thesiger about fifty years ago because his Bedouin friends refused to allow him in because they believed he wouldn't survive the town's fierce conservatism. He would have been shocked to learn that Nizwa is currently Oman's second-most popular tourist destination. However, Nizwa, or the "Pearl of Islam," as it's frequently called, is still a conservative town that appreciates a little decorum from its tourists.
 It was the seat of factional imams until the 1950s.</p>
